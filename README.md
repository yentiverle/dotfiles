# Dotfiles
These are all my dotfiles shared across every operating system.
Everything here is managed by [Rotz](https://github.com/volllly/rotz), which handles the linking and installation of my tools.

Everything is structured into folders for ease of use.

For Windows I've been moving to WinGet where possible.
