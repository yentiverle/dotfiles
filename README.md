# Yenti's Dotfiles
**Warning**: you shouldn't blindly copy my configs unless you know understand what the settings do.

This is my configuration repository, files left in the $HOME directory such as .bashrc can be found in xdg_home.
Files and folders which are typically stored in XDG_CONFIG each have their own folder in the root (such as nvim).
There's also a general list of tools I use frequently.

## Contents
- Neovim config
- Configs stored in the $HOME directory (bashrc, aliasses, tmux, ...)

## Neovim
Has it's own README file in the folder :)

## Linux
- [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) - Powerline-patched fonts, I mainly use Jetbrains Mono but when I feel like swapping it's always to one of these
- [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) - There's no configs for this but I use this on a daily basis

## Windows
All of my workstations run Windows but I run WSL on all of them, this is just a list of tools I use to make Windows more efficient for me

- [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) - Because package managers rule and WinGet doesn't have packages for everything I use yet (once it does I'll probably switch)
- [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys) - I mostly use this for Run and Awake but all the features in it are helpful
- [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal) - Probably the best terminal available for Windows (I think this is shipped with Win11?)
